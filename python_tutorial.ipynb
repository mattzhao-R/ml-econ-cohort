{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is a programming language?\nRules that convert strings and numbers to some \"machine code output\". We use programming languages in our cohort because it allows us to speed up the rate which we perform tasks, such as by making it easier to:\n1. Analyze and visualize data \n2. Run machine learning algorithms\nYou could do all of this by hand, but I wouldn't recommend it. It'd be quite painful. \n\n### What is Python? Why do we use Python?\nPython is an example of a programming language. It's known for being easy to learn and being one of the best languages to conduct data analysis in. We use Python for those reasons above. Python is easy to conduct data analysis in because it has many powerful libraries which make it convenient to work with data, and run machine learning algorithms. Instead of having to code the algorithms yourself, you can reference these libraries. \nSome examples: sklearn (machine learning library), pandas and numpy (data analysis and visualization library)\n\n### What is a script? What is a notebook?\nA script is a file (think like a .docx) that contains code you write. Scripts are specific to each programming language, and python scripts have .py extensions. All the code in a script is \"run\" in one go. \nA notebook is a file that also contains code you write, but the code is split up into chunks called cells. You run code by cell, and it's a lot faster/more convenient if you want to just visualize preliminary results. Deepnote is a platform that allows you to run python notebooks on it - we use it because it's really convenient and doesn't require installation. \nTo use deepnote, create an account and click create a notebook.
